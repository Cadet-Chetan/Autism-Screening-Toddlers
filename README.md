# Autism Screening System for Toddlers

This project is a **machine learning-based screening system** to detect early signs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in toddlers.  
It uses behavioral data and classification models to predict the likelihood of autism.

## 🚀 Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  

## 📂 Files
- **Autism_Screening_Toddlers.ipynb** → Main Kaggle notebook with all steps  
- **dataset.csv** → Dataset used (if publicly available)  
- **requirements.txt** → Python dependencies  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle  

## 🏃 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
